Percona XtraDB Cluster cluster with three nodes.

To use this setup, you just need to edit the variables in the .env file.
You can choose the network and each nodes' IP address within it.

You can change the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME variable to be able to identify the
network and containers created by name, in case you need to do housekeeping
later on (check below on how to remove all created containers, networks
and volumes).

You can also modify the PXC container versions by using the PXC_TAG variable.
You can find the supported tags in the following link:

https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster/tags/

In future versions, we will support setting other container images.

After you edit the .env file, you can start the cluster by simply running:

# docker-compose up

or 

# docker-compose up -d

to spaw the process in the background. You can check what containers are
running via `docker-compose` with:

# docker-compose ps

To remove all containers, networks and volumes created:

# docker-compose down
